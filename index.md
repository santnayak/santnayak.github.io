# Santhosh Nayak

I design and build **backend and distributed systems** with a focus on **AI-enabled tooling**, **auditability**, and **security-first architecture**.

I currently split my time between:
- building **B2B SaaS products**
- experimenting with **AI agents and tool execution safety**
- documenting architectural decisions and trade-offs

This site is a lightweight, versioned engineering notebook:
- **Blog** — technical notes from real systems and experiments
- **Projects** — focused builds and prototypes (some production-bound)

---

## Current Focus

- **Zeitly** — a B2B time-tracking and workforce management SaaS in active development  
  Focus areas: multi-tenant architecture, audit logs, compliance-readiness, and clean UX for SMBs

- **AI agent auditability** — tracing prompts, tool calls, and side effects  
  (nanobot / openclaw-style agents behind a controlled proxy)

- **Policy enforcement at the LLM boundary**  
  Redaction, allow/deny rules, and safe defaults before side effects occur

- **Observability & operability**  
  Designing systems that are debuggable, inspectable, and explainable by default

## What I Work On

### Systems & Architecture
- backend services (Python, JAVA, REST, async systems)
- multi-tenant SaaS design
- event-driven and service-oriented architectures
- data modeling and persistence (PostgreSQL, SQLite for tooling)

### AI & Agent Infrastructure
- LLM proxies and instrumentation
- prompt + response tracing (Langfuse-style)
- agent tool execution (shell, filesystem, network)
- guardrails and policy layers for agents

### Security & Compliance-Minded Design
- audit logs and traceability
- least-privilege execution
- boundary enforcement between intent and side effects
- privacy-aware prompt handling and redaction

### Delivery & Engineering Leadership
- breaking down ambiguous problems into deliverable scopes
- writing ADRs and technical documentation
- prioritizing risk, operability, and long-term maintainability
- coordinating backend, frontend, and infra concerns
